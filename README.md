Convenience functions for statistical analysis using R

This is a work in progress. I am helping my wife who is teaching a traditional advanced high school statistics class that uses calculators. I am trying to create a R package with tested functions. I am starting with ideas from the NIST [Statistical Software and the e-Handbook of Statistical Methods](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/dataplot.htm). NIST supplies examples both in R and in Dataplot. My plan is to update this for current approaches used by the R-STATS community.
