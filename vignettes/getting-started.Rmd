# Introduction

R and R-Studio provide a very powerful environment for statistical
analysis and visualization of data. R is a Open Source language
developed by statisticians for statistical analysis and visualization of
a wide range of data. It is both powerful and popular. Like any
software there is a learning curve. Happily, the `#rstats` community
on Twitter is very helpful. Examples are typically a Google search
away.

## Where to get the software

Our intention is to install the software on the LCS computers. If you
have a computer at home, you can get the software and install it
on your own system. The software runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your
teacher can give you some hints to help you with your system.

## How to get help

Most of those who answer questions are volunteers. The likelihood of
getting a response increases when you show that you are being
considerate.

1. Do a Google search first.
2. Make your question specific. Explain what you have tried and what
did not work as you expected.
3. Make a **minimum reproducible example** that works with a simple
data set that is easily available. Explain what did not work as
expected.
