# Introduction

This example is adapted from data supplied by
[Ron Larson and Betsy Faber](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Statistics-Picturing-World-6th/dp/0321911210), **Elementary Statistics Picturing the World**, 6th edition,
in Chapter 6 p. 344.

A vendor claims that the variation of a batch of washers is within
$\pm 0.002$ in. The customer measured the thickness of 15 randomly
selected washers and reported the data (in inches) below.

```{r inputData}
dat <- c(0.422, 0.424, 0.424, 0.430, 0.419,
         0.424, 0.420, 0.424, 0.425, 0.425,
         0.423, 0.431, 0.437, 0.422, 0.434)
```
Does this sample of washers meet the variance criterion at the 
95% confidence level? We will compute the 95% confidence interval
of our sample.

```{r computeVar"}
library(statshelpR)
library(knitr)

df <- var.interval(dat, 0.002, 0.95)
kable(df)
```

# Summary

Note that the 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation
`r df$Value[7]` - `r df$Value[6]` and does not contain 0.002. Therefore
the batch us unacceptable.
